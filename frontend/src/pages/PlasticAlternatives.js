                  <p className="mb-4">
                     At SustainCred, we are dedicated to supporting small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in their journey towards sustainability. Our mission is to help businesses in the environmentally friendly plastic alternatives sector generate carbon credits, contributing to a greener future.
                  </p>
                  <p className="mb-4">
                     Plastic pollution is a significant environmental issue, with millions of tons of plastic waste entering our oceans and ecosystems annually. Plastics do not biodegrade; instead, they break down into microplastics that persist in the environment for centuries, harming wildlife and potentially entering the human food chain. The production of plastic also contributes to climate change, as it is derived from fossil fuels and generates substantial greenhouse gas emissions.
                  </p>
                  <p className="mb-4">
                     Alternatives to plastic, such as biodegradable materials and reusable products, can significantly reduce this environmental burden. By replacing single-use plastics with sustainable alternatives, we can lower greenhouse gas emissions and reduce plastic pollution. This shift supports the goals of the <strong><a href="https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement/the-paris-agreement" className="text-primary hover:underline">Paris Agreement</a></strong>, which aims to limit global warming to well below 2Â°C, and aligns with net-zero targets by minimizing the carbon footprint of materials used in everyday products.
                  </p>
                  <p className="mb-4">
                     Carbon credits play a crucial role in promoting plastic alternatives. They provide financial incentives for companies to invest in sustainable practices and technologies. By generating carbon credits, projects that replace plastic with eco-friendly materials can offset their emissions and attract funding. This not only helps in reducing overall carbon emissions but also accelerates the transition to a circular economy, where waste is minimized, and resources are reused.
